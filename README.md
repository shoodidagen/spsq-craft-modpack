This is a custom modpack and resource repository compiled from .jar files that have passed testing on a linix based forge minecraft server. I dont own most of the coding put into these files however needed a repository in order to grab these from the linux server using Git Clone. Stong attempts will be made to tag or at least mention the code authors.
